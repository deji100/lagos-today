# A Clothing E-commerce App

- Built an E-commerce web app for a clothing store. It was built with the python framework(Django), JavaScript, Git and some interesting dependencies.
- It uses Django generic view (e.g CreateView for user creation) and LoginView from django.contrib.auth.views for user authentication.
- The web app was integrated with Paystack payment system for user to make payment while purchasing a product. SQL was the choice for this app because of its simplicity. 
- The app also contains a cart page where users orders are prepared for a purchase through the payment system (paystack). It was hosted on Heroku but on a free hosting plan.
- Analysed our user needs and design software. 
- Modified existing software to correct errors or improve overall performance. 
- Oversaw and assisted with software testing and validation procedures and programming. 
- Gathered and evaluated user feedback in order to improve software for better usability. 
- Designed databases for specific application areas.
